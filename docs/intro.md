# Quick Start

Welcome to IsleStats docs! Here you can find information on how to configure and use IsleStats.

## Getting Started

### Add bot to server

You can start using IsleStats by [adding the bot to your Discord guild](https://islestats.net/invite) or by [installing it on your Discord account directly](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1174018516039508218&scope=applications.commands&integration_type=1).

_For an introduction of what IsleStats can do for your server, please visit [our website](https://islestats.net)._

### Permissions (guild installs only)

IsleStats requires various different permissions to perform different tasks. Non-essential permissions can be revoked, however, functionality will be limited.

A list of permissions and their respective functionalities is as follows:

- **Manage Roles**: Used for updating autoroles and the linked role for guild members.
- **Manage Nicknames**: Used for syncing members' nicknames to the username of their respective linked players.
- **Use External Emojis**: Used for enhancing the display of information through the use of infographics.
