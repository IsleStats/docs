# Autoroles

Autoroles allow roles to be automatically assigned / removed from member's, based on their linked player's profile. They allow for tiered roles based on different MCCI stats and profile information such as trophies, coins, or crown level.

Autorole roles stack, this means that if you have a role for 10,000 trophies, you might also have a role for 5,000 trophies.

For information on how to configure autoroles for your Discord guild, see [Configure Autoroles](/guild-guides/configure-autoroles).
