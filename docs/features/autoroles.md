# Autoroles

Autoroles allow roles to be automatically assigned / removed from member's, based on their linked player's profile. They allow for tiered roles based on different MCCI stats and profile information such as trophies, coins, or crown level.

Autorole roles stack, this means that if you have a role for 10,000 trophies, you might also have a role for 5,000 trophies.

For information on how to configure autoroles for your Discord guild, see [Configure Autoroles](/guild-guides/configure-autoroles).

### Autorole Updating

A member's autoroles will be updated whenever a sync is initiated, see [Sync Your Account](/user-guides/syncing/) for more information.

[MCCI API visibility](/user-guides/enable-mcci-api/) will also impact how autoroles are updated. If an autorole exists for a category that you have your MCCI API visibility disabled for, you will not recieve Discord roles for that autorole; they will instead be removed if you have them.
